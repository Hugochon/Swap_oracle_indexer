# TD_Front_Wagmi

Welcome to TD_Front_Wagmi, a decentralized voting system deployed on Vercel. The live site can be accessed [here](https://td-front-wagmi-git-main-hugochon.vercel.app/).

## Overview

TD_Front_Wagmi leverages blockchain technology to enable users to create and participate in decentralized votes. Each vote is represented as an NFT minted to the DAO contract, featuring various characteristics:

- **Question:** The primary query with two possible answers, A and B.
- **Option A and Option B:** Descriptions for the respective choices.
- **Counter A and Counter B:** Track the number of votes for each option.
- **Starting_TimeStamp:** The timestamp at the creation of the vote.
- **Ending_Timestamp:** The timestamp indicating when the vote concludes, specified by the user.

The smart contract is deployed at this address: `0xdfe95facf0Cac0211742814BD7e1A434Be6C35A4`. The contract code is available [here](https://github.com/Hugochon/TD_Front_Wagmi_Contract).

## Functionalities

1. **Propose a Vote:**
   - Users can create new votes with various parameters.

2. **Vote on Existing Votes:**

4. **Vote Security:**
